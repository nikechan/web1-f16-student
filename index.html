	<h3>Sites I Like...</h3>
	
		<div>
			<ul>
			
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.moviepilot.com/">Movie Pilot</a>
			<p>I'm a huge movie fanatic so Movie Pilot is definitely one of the sites I usually visit. Not only does it have great content but great design that's bold and also stands out. :D
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired</a>
			<p>Wired's website and magazine designs are one of my favorites. I like how they're always so creative and always manage to think out of the box.
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.bustle.com/">Bustle</a>
			<p>Bustle's site is neat and sleek and although it might look boring to some I think Bustle did a sucessful job because it goes with all kinds of content/images.
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.nextrembrandt.com/">The Next Rembrandt</a>
			<p>I love art history and what I love about this site is the delicacy of the design and how detailed it is.
			</p>
			</li>
		
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.nurturedigital.com/">Nurture Digital</a>
			<p>
			This site is just wow. I think I spent the longest time on this site compared to the rest. Great design, great color scheme, great graphics.

	<h3>Why am I taking this class?</h3>
		
		<p>I am taking this class because I don't have any experience in coding/web design. I've recently found out that I'm really into working digital and I'm interested in learning about web design, as well as gaining new skills. I hope to be able to create my first website that I'll be proud of. The technologies I'm interested in are virtual reality and the Samsung S7.
