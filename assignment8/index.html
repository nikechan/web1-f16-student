				I need a personal portfolio because I need some sort of platform for my work and my identity as a designer. Not only would I use it to represent myself but I would also link it on job or internship applications. I want to be able to convey that I’m someone who’s organized and neat but at the same time creative through my use of layout and typography. My work mainly consists of design projects I’ve done in classes; I plan on showing only a select few of them (quality over quantity). From this portfolio website I want to tell my viewers that I’m a professional who’s dedicated to her craft.
