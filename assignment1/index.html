	<h3>Sites I Like...</h3>
	
	<p>
		<ul>
			
		<li><a href="moviepilot.com">Movie Pilot</a>
		<p>I'm a huge movie fanatic so Movie Pilot is definitely one of the sites I usually visit. Not only does it have great content but great design that's bold and also stands out. :D
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="wired.com">Wired</a>
		<p>Wired's website and magazine designs are one of my favorites. I like how they're always so creative and always manage to think out of the box.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="bustle.com">Bustle</a>
		<p>Bustle's site is neat and sleek and although it might look boring to some I think Bustle did a sucessful job because it goes with all kinds of content/images.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="nextrembrandt.com">The Next Rembrandt</a>
		<p>I love art history and what I love about this site is the delicacy of the design and how detailed it is.
		</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<a href="nurturedigital.com">Nurture Digital</a>
		<p>
		This site is just wow. I think I spent the longest time on this site compared to the rest. Great design, great color scheme, great graphics.

	<h3>Why am I taking this class?</h3>
		
	<p>I am taking this class because I don't have any experience in coding/web design. I've recently found out that I'm really into working digital and I'm really interested in learning about web design, as well as gaining new skills. I hope to be able to create my first website that I'm proud of. The technologies I'm interested in are virtual reality and the Samsung S7.
